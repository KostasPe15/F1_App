# F1_App
An F1 app that shows the 2022 teams and drivers using database.

In order to run the app you have to use the f1.sql database and the php scripts in the php files folder.

I use xampp, so all I have to do is upload the database in localhost and put the php scripts in the htdocs folder in xampp's files.
